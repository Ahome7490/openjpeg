Good news everyone!

[OpenJPEG 2.1.2](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/releases/tag/v2.1.2) is released today.


Important security fixes and third party libraries update.

[Changelog](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/blob/openjpeg-2.1/CHANGELOG.md)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/compare/v2.1.1...v2.1.2)

Note that meanwhile, in the master branch, an important improvement has been merged, namely T1 optimizations and multithreading support (contribution from Even Rouault … Thanks a lot !). A (much) faster OpenJPEG is on track … Stay tuned for v2.2.0.

Enjoy,

Antonin
